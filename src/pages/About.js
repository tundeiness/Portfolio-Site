//       The best way to consume React-Bootstrap is via the npm package which you can install with npm (or yarn if you prefer).

//       If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don`
//       t want to use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to install vanilla Bootstrap as well.

//       In case you are using Sass the simplest way is to include the Bootstrapâ€™s source Sass files in your main Sass file and then require it on your src/index.js or App.js file. This applies to a typical create-react-app application in other use cases you might have to setup the bundler of your choice to compile Sass/SCSS stylesheets to CSS.
